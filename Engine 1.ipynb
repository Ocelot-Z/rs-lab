The two of you began scouring through old furniture, leaving nothing unturned, yet, after two long hours, your hands held nothing but dust. You sensed the Professor’s eyes laced with disappointment, perhaps he has already given up the search, for to encounter a rare artifact like the one he described must require great deal of luck. But your desire for a better life fuels your persistence to hunt the fourth book down. You revisit the drawers you may have overlooked, potential compartments that are hidden behind intricate mechanisms like the seance table. And as you attempt to wrestle a large wooden shelf to another wall, your slip of the hand causes it to collide with the wall behind it, producing a hollow thud. Professor Dagger immediately placed his hands against the false wall, sliding across its surface gently like one would a body. Soon he senses the concealed mechanism that safeguards the secret shut, which upon a gentle press, unveils a dark corridor effluviating a pungent scent.\n",
