He often reminds you that the facility is in fact even older, and has been here since the 60’s. You made a quick phone call to Alex, a man you owe money to, and explained to him that you will pay him back in a few days once you have it, to which he responded with distasteful threats. The manager took out an old tin box and placed it on his desk and reached towards you with an open palm, gesturing for you to pay up, which you obliged. Upon handing you a key for your newly owned storage room, he urged you to watch some old security footage.\n",
