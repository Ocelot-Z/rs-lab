This moment, this decision, feels like the culmination of every challenge you've faced, every demon you've fought, both within and without.\n",

Despite his efforts to uncover the mysteries within and his desperate fight for survival, he ultimately faced a creature beyond comprehension. His final stand, marked by courage and determination, was not enough to overcome the horror that awaited him. Kyle's story concludes in the shadow of the unknown, a reminder of the dangers that lurk in the pursuit of forbidden knowledge."
