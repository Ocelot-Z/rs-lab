Your critical thinking and a stroke of luck with finding the hidden keys allowed you to escape, but not without significant cost to your mental health. The horrors witnessed within the storage, compounded by the loss of Professor Dagger to the creature, have left you deeply traumatized. Your journey away from the storage facility is one marked by fear, confusion, and an overwhelming sense of dread for what the future might hold, knowing that such horrors lurk in the shadows of the world."
